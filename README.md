Queue
=====

A fast Golang queue using a ring-buffer, based on the version suggested by Dariusz GÃ³recki. Using this instead of other, simpler, queue implementations (slice+append or linked list) provides substantial memory and time benefits, and fewer GC pauses.

The v2 subfolder requires Go 1.18 or later and makes use of generics.

Follows semantic versioning using https://gopkg.in/ - import from gopkg.in/amirvalhalla/queue.v1 for guaranteed API stability.


### Usage:
 ```
 go get -u https://github.com/amirvalhalla/queue
 ```
